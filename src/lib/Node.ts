 * @description
 *
 * An abstract tree structure based on EventDispatcher.
 *
 * The tree constructed with AbstractNode is designed to be a "scene graph" :
 * - N-ary (多叉树). A node can have multiple children.
 * - directed (有向). From the root to leaves.
 * - acyclic (无环). No loop. There is one and only one path to every node.
 * - rooted/oriented (有单一根). Every node has a single parent. Every scene has a single root.
 *
 * Also you can not re-use a removed node or change its position.
 */

/**
 * @loop_detection
 * Since we do not allow a node has multiple parents. The only scenario of loop
 * is when the root is added to a inode/leaf of the tree.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * root.add(inode)
 * inode.add(leaf)
 * leaf.add(inode) // error
 * leaf.add(root) // loop
 * inode.add(root) // loop

/**
 * @explain ### Why not using `this` as the type of `parent`?
 *
 * > `this` as a type, will always refer to the subclass.
 * > While `parent` doesn't have to be the same subclass with this.
 *
 * Technically. Anything extending AbstractNode can be added to the node-tree.
 * LayerA->parent doesn't have to be an instance of LayerA.
 * It can be an instance of LayerB, or Polaris, or some wried stuff used as a container.
 *
 * If a system needs all the nodes fit into a specific sub-class.
 * (Like Polaris.gl needs every node to be either Layer or Polaris, instead of AbstractNode)
 * It should add constrains in sub-class. With following principles:
 *
 * - AbstractNode shouldn't mind logics of its sub-classes.
 * - For parent/child/root, use specific class instead of `this`.
 * - Only use `this` if it's actually about itself.
 *
 * The underlying problem of this:
 * - This kind of feature should be implemented with mixins.
