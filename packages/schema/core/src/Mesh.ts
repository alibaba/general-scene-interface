/**
 * A GSI scene is structured as a classic scene graph.
 * Every object in a scene is a node. All nodes form into a tree.
 * Transformations and visibilities are inherited down from the root to leaf nodes.
 *
 * The tree must meet the following constraints:
 * - N-ary (多叉树). A node can have multiple children.
 * - directed (有向). From the root to leaves.
 * - acyclic (无环). No loop. There is one and only one path to every node.
 * - rooted/oriented (有单一根). Every node has a single parent. Every scene has a single root.
 *
 * Also you can not re-use a removed node or change its position.
 *
 * @note When adding a node to a `parent.children`. It is necessary to set the `node.parent` too.
